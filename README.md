# Layton Fangame

A Layton Fangame built with the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com).

## Getting started

Start by installing the Unity Hub if you don't have it yet: https://unity.com/download

Then, install the Unity Editor with the Unity Hub. Make sure to pick version **2021.3.1f1**.

If you don't have it yet, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your machine too. Make
sure you have [Git LFS too](https://git-lfs.github.com/). If you used the Git installer on
Windows, it's installed by default.

If this is your first time with Git or Github, [generate an SSH Key and add it to your Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

Make sure your ssh key works with github:
```sh
> ssh git@github.com
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Hi <user>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.
```

Make sure you have setup Git LFS too:
```
git lfs install
```

Let's clone the repo now!
```
git clone git@github.com:Layton-Fangame/Layton-Fangame.git
```

In the Unity Hub, switch the "Projects" tab, click "Add project from disk" and point to the repository where you cloned this repo.

You're now ready to open the project! Open it and have fun!

Useful Unity Resources:
* The [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/UnityManual.html) is the reference document. It may require some familiarity with Unity to be fully understandable, but also includes some How-To pages.
* Unity has built [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/), which gathers some tutorials about Unity. You may find them a little too beginner-oriented though. If you are already familiar with programming, give it a quick look then switch to the manual which also has some How-To pages.
