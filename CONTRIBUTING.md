Thank you for considering contributing to the project, we're glad you're willing to help!

We recommend joining the Discord Server to discuss your changes with the community: https://discord.gg/zaRXcCFYE7. The #programming channel is where most technical discussions take place.

Feel free to fork this project, make contributions on your side then open a pull request targeting the `main` branch to submit your contributions.

We will happily add you to the organization and grant you write access to the repo after your first significant contributions (that is, adding a comma or fixing a typo doesn't count :P).

We strive to be a welcoming open source community. If you feel uncomfortable, please contact a team member in private, we will do our best to make sure everyone here has a great time.

While we don't expect to have to enforce it, we expect contributors to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant 2.0 Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) when interacting with our community.
